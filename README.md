## ZeroStore for iOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylebshr/zerostore-ios.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/kylebshr/zerostore-ios)

An iOS implementation of [zerostore](https://github.com/joseph346/zerostore) by joseph346. This was made mostly for fun â€” I'm not a cryptogrography expert, and cannot vouch for the security of this project. 

Includes an app extension for use in browsers.

## What is this, and why does it exist?

To quote the [original project](https://github.com/joseph346/zerostore):

>The goal of this project is to serve as a proof-of-concept for a zero-storage password management system. This means that all the information needed to generate a secure, unique, per-site password can be kept in a user's head. In this way, users can eliminate password reuse without having to memorize multiple passwords or synch password databases between devices. A user should be able to go on any device with this program and have access to all of their passwords without having to import any data.

## How to setup

Fork/clone the repo, then navigate to the directory and run `pod install`.
