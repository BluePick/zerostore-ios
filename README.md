# ZeroStore for iOS

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/kylebshr/zerostore-ios.svg?token=UiKDm2zaX2bq1nNqEV5r&branch=develop)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/kylebshr/zerostore-ios)

An iOS implementation of [zerostore](https://github.com/joseph346/zerostore) by joseph346. This was made mostly for fun â€” I'm not a cryptogrography expert, and cannot vouch for the security of this project. 

Includes an app extension for use in browsers.

## How to setup

Fork/clone the repo, then navigate to the directory and run `pod install`.
