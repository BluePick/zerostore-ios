This was made mostly for fun â€” I'm not a cryptogrography expert, and cannot vouch for the security of this project. \r\n\r\nIncludes an app extension for use in browsers.\r\n\r\n[![Available on the AppStore](http://cl.ly/WouG/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.svg)](#) \r\n\r\n(Coming Soon)\r\n\r\n## What is this, and why does it exist?\r\n\r\nTo quote the [original project](https://github.com/joseph346/zerostore):\r\n\r\n>The goal of this project is to serve as a proof-of-concept for a zero-storage password management system. This means that all the information needed to generate a secure, unique, per-site password can be kept in a user's head. In this way, users can eliminate password reuse without having to memorize multiple passwords or synch password databases between devices. A user should be able to go on any device with this program and have access to all of their passwords without having to import any data.\r\n\r\n## How to setup\r\n\r\nFork/clone the repo, then navigate to the directory and run `pod install`.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylebshr/zerostore-ios.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/kylebshr/zerostore-ios)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
